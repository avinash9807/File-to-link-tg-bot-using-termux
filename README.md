# 🚀 Telegram Direct Link Generator (Localhost)

A high-performance Python bot designed for Termux to generate direct download links for Telegram files. It streams data directly to your download manager via `127.0.0.1` to avoid double data consumption.

## ✨ Features
- **Zero Data Double:** Streams directly to the downloader without saving to phone storage.
- **Resume Support:** Supports HTTP Range requests for interrupted downloads.
- **Multi-Threading:** Compatible with ADM/IDM multi-part downloading for maximum speed.
- **Owner Security:** Restricted access to specific User IDs defined in `config.py`.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `main.py`: Core streaming engine and bot logic.
- `config.py`: Configuration for API credentials and authorized owners.
- `requirements.txt`: Required dependencies.

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

The config.py file acts as the Central Settings Module for your bot. It separates your sensitive credentials from the main logic, making the code cleaner and more secure.
1. API_ID and API_HASH
Purpose: These are your Telegram "App Credentials."
How it works: They allow the Telethon library to communicate with Telegram's official servers. Every application using Telegram's API must have these unique identifiers to be recognized by the system.
2. BOT_TOKEN
Purpose: This is the unique "Identity Key" for your bot.
How it works: Generated by @BotFather, this token tells the script which specific bot account it should control. It acts as both a username and a password for the bot.
3. OWNERS (Access Control List)
Purpose: This is a Security Whitelist containing Telegram User IDs.
How it works: * The script checks every incoming message against this list.
If a user's ID is not in this list, the bot will refuse to generate a link or stream the file.
This prevents random strangers from using your Termux server and consuming your mobile data or CPU

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
   pkg install python -y
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the Bot:

   ```bash
   python main.py

3.Usage:

​Send /start to the bot on Telegram.
​Forward a file to the bot.
​Copy the generated localhost link.
​Paste the link into ADM/IDM and ensure threads are set to 8 or 16.
